  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
    <p>Two households, both alike in dignity
      (In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),
      From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
      Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
      From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
      A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;
      Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
      Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
      The fearful passage of their death-marked love
      And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
      Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove,
      Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
      The which, if you with patient ears attend,
      What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
